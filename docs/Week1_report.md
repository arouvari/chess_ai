Weekly report 1:

Most work on this week was done deciding what topic would be chosen for the project.
When I had chosen the project, I started researching useful information what I could use in my implementation and thinking of things to keep in mind while
developing this project.

The program repository has been made and poetry has been added for program management.
Specification document has been added and written to the docs folder in the root.

I learned about different ways of representing the chess board in code, what algorithms to use 
and basic knowledge how the minimax algorithm works. I learned also about useful ways
of implementing evaluation of the current position with material difference and 
the positioning of the pieces.

I think the challenging part about project will be having accurate evaluation of
in which squares the pieces are more valuable and getting the more complex rules of the game to work.

The next thing I will start working on is the main functionality of the game and getting
the simple rules of the game working.
