Specification document

Degree Program: Bachelor's in Computer Science
Documentation Language: English

Programming Language: Python, Only proficient enough for peer-review in this language
Algorithms: I will be using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the ai decision making.

Answer to a problem: I will be developing an AI for the game chess that can evaluate
the best possible moves on the board based on evaluating the current position
and next possible moves for the opponent. This AI can be played against and can beat
intermediate level players consistently.

Inputs: Chess moves played on an GUI translated to notation.
Outputs: Chess notation used by the AI translated to a piece moving on the GUI.

Time and Space Complexity: The minimax algorithms time complexity is O(bm) where b is
the game branching trees factor and m is the trees maximum depth.

Core of the project: The core of the project is a chess AI that can calculate the best moves using 
the minimax algorithm and evaluation of the current position on the board.
